# **Chapter I** **Introduction**

Welcome to the first `Kernel from Scratch` project.

Finally some real coding, I’m pretty sure you were annoyed by the Linux Kernel
project. In the `Kernel from Scratch` subjects you are going to write a kernel from
scratch (no way ?), without any existing software, API, or such.

Once you will be done with those projects and standing on the shoulder of your nonrevolutionnary-OS, you will be in right to laugh at those ordinary Javascript developers,
who obviously, don’t know anything about coding.

On a more serious note, those kernel programming skills are not quite spread in the
IT world, so **take your time** to understand each and every different points in those
projects. One does not simply consider himself a ’Kernel developer’ if one only knows
things about drivers or syscalls, like a sysadmin only knows things about iptables or
softwares installation... It’s a package of skills.

A word about the code itself : the `Kernel From Scratch` is divided into many
projects, each one dealing with a specific aspect of kernel programming. All of those
projects are linked together. So when you’ll code those amazing features, keep in mind
that your kernel must be flexible and that functions must easily fit in. Half the time you’ll
spend on these projects will be adding links between different aspects of your Kernel.

For instance, you must write memory code before processus & execution code. But
processus must use memory, right ? So, you gotta link those two ! So keep your code
*clean*, and your internal API simple.

Good luck, and most of all, have fun :)

# **Chapter II** **Objectives**

At the end of this subject, you will have:

* A kernel you can boot via `GRUB`
* An `ASM` bootable base
* A basic kernel library, with basics functions and types
* Some basic code to print some stuff on the screen
* A basic "Hello world" kernel

Actually, that’s not that much code. This subject is an introduction to kernel development. A (wo)man must learn.


# **Chapter III** **General instructions**

### **III.1 Code and Execution**

#### **III.1.1 Emulation**

The following part is not mandatory, you are free to use any virtual manager you want to,
however, i suggest you to use `KVM` . It’s a `Kernel Virtual Manager`, and have advanced
execution and debugs functions. All of the examples below will use `KVM` .

#### **III.1.2 Language**

All of `Kernel from Scratch` subjects have no constraints on the language you want to
use.
C language is not mandatory at all, you can use any language. However, keep in mind
that all language are not kernel friendly. So... Yes, you could code a Kernel in javascript,
but are you sure it’s a good idea ?
Also, a lot of example on the documentations are in C, so remember that you will do
’code translation’ all the time if you choose a different language.
Furthermore, all of the features of a language cannot be used in a basic kernel.
Let’s take C++ for example:
C++ use ’new’ to make allocation, class and structures declaration. But in your kernel
you do not have a memory interface (yet), so you cannot use those features in the beginning.
A lot of language can be used instead of `C`, like `C++`, `Rust`, `Go`, etc. You could even code
your entire kernel in `ASM` if you want !
So yeah, choose a language, but choose wisely.

### **III.2 Compilation**

#### **III.2.1 Compilers**

You can choose any compilers you want. I personnaly use `gcc` and `nasm` . A Makefile
must be turned in.

#### **III.2.2 Flags**

In order to boot your kernel without any dependencies, you must compile your code with
the following flags (Adapt the flags for your language, those ones are a `C++` example):

* `-fno-builtin`
* `-fno-exception`
* `-fno-stack-protector`
* `-fno-rtti`
* `-nostdlib`
* `-nodefaultlibs`


Pay attention to `-nodefaultlibs` and `-nostdlib` . Your Kernel will be compiled on a
host system, yes, but cannot be linked to any existing library on that host, otherwise it
will not be executed.

### **III.3 Linking**


You cannot use an existing linker in order to link your kernel. As written above, your
kernel will not boot. So, you must create a linker for your kernel.
Be carefull, you `CAN` use the ’ld’ binary available on your host, but you `CANNOT` use the
.ld file of your host.

### **III.4 Architecture**


The i386 (x86) architecture is `mandatory` (you can thank me later).

### **III.5 Documentation**


There is a lot of documentation available, good and bad. I personnaly think the `[OSDev](http://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page)`
wiki is one of the best.

# **Chapter IV** **Mandatory part**

#### **IV.0.1 Base**

You must make a kernel, bootable with `GRUB`, who can write characters on screen.
In order to do that, you have to:

* Install `GRUB` on an virtual image
* Write an `ASM` boot code that handles multiboot header, and use `GRUB` to init and
call main function of the kernel itself.
* Write basic kernel code of the choosen language.
* Compile it with correct flags, and link it to make it bootable.
* Once all of those steps above are done, you can write some helpers like kernel types
or basic functions (strlen, strcmp, ...)
* Your work must not exceed 10 MB.
* Code the interface between your kernel and the screen.
* Display `"42"` on the screen.

For the link part, you must create a linker file with the `GNU linker (ld)` . Some docs
[here.](http://www.math.utah.edu/docs/info/ld_3.html#SEC4)

#### **IV.0.2 Makefile**

Your makefile must compile all your source files with the right flags and the right compiler. Keep in mind that your kernel will use at least two different languages (ASM and
whatever-you-choose), so make (<- joke) your Makefile’s rules correctly.

After compilation, all the objects must be linked together in order to create the final
Kernel binary (Cf. Linker part).

# **Chapter V** **Bonus part**

The following extra is intended to be useful:

* Add scroll and cursor support to your I/O interface.
* Add colors support to your I/O interface.
* Add helpers like printf / printk in order to print information / debug easily.
* Handle keyboard entries and print them.
* Handle different screens, and keyboard shortcuts to switch easily between then.

# **Chapter VI** **Turn-in and peer-evaluation**

Turn your work into your `GiT` repository, as usual. Only the work present on your repository will be graded in defense.

Your must turn in your code, a Makefile and a basic virtual image for your kernel.
Carefull with that image, your kernel does nothing with it yet, so there is no need for it
to be sized like an elephant. 10 MB is the upper bound, deal with it.
